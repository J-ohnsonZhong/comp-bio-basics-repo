# comp-bio-basics-repo
Learning focused on Python, basic data-handling, gene expression analysis, and introductory sequence analysis.  Built from wet-lab background recorded with notebooks and small scripts over time.

This repository documents my first steps into computational biology, starting from no prior programming background. It contains small Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks focused on basic data handling, simple gene expression analysis, and introductory sequence analysis.

## Contents
- Python fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, file I/O)
- Basic data handling and visualization
- Simple gene expression analysis
- Introductory DNA sequence analysis (FASTA parsing, GC content, motif counting)

Folders are organized by week or topic to reflect learning progression.

## Tools
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  

This repo is intended to show growth and hands-on learning from a wet-lab background.
